these are codes for a device that measures road quality. it runs on my raspberry pi 5 using a vertical lidar, an accelerometer, a gps, a temperature and pressure sensor and a atmospheric pressure sensor. i want to replace the physical gps with the one on my mobile phone. fOr this i've installed the "tasker" app on my android and i want to send the gps data to the raspberry pi every 5 seconds. can you change the gps data aquisition so that instead of getting the coordinates from the current gps it gets them from my phone? make sure you changed all the needed files
